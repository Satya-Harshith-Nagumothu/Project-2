# Project Description: Descriptive Analysis of Building Permit Records
In this assignment I show how i designed a Data Analytic Platform (DAP) and implemented it for the City of Vancouver project, i will also explain the datasets used and the various derivations and DAP design using the datasets I selected. I got my datasets from website [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/issued-building-permits/information/) related to the Vancouver City operations.

## Project Title: Understanding Building Permits Issued Percentages
The primary goal here is to conduct a descriptive analysis of the yearly trends in Building permits issued based on the datasets taken from [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/issued-building-permits/information/). I am planning to find the percentages of permits issued for each category or type over time, which can help inform operational strategies for see the probability of getting a permit.
## Project Objective:
* Design a dAP for Building Permits Issed using Building Permits Dataset.
* I decided this will be my dataset to get information related to percentages of permits issued for each category or type over time in city of Vancouver.
* The 11 steps of information is shown below: <br>
## Datasets
* There are two datasets which I used are .
* The first dataset is **"cummulative_issued-building-permits-2024"**, it contains information on all building permits issued:
  * [cummulative_issued-building-permits 2024.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17004724/cummulative_issued-building-permits.2024.xlsx) contains the information of all building permits issued.
* The second datset is **"Approved-issued-building-permits-2024"**, it Contains details on approved building permits issued:
  * [Approved-issued-building-permits-2024.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17004726/Approved-issued-building-permits-2024.xlsx) contains the information of approved building permits issued.
* Using both these datasets I will be planning my DAP for City of Vancouver.
## Methodology:
* I will explain the process of designing the DAP below for Buildign Permits of City of vancouver:
